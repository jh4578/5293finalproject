# Data Overview

## Data explainations

The data was retrieved from yahoo.finance.com and fred.stlouisfed.org. It has 14 columns, and this project will be focusing on Date, Open, Volume, CPI, core CPI, gdp, unemployment rate, m1, m2, and DFF. 

Here are the explanations for these variables:

1, Date: the date of the data, the first day of each month.

2, Open: the stock opening price.

3, Volume: number of shares that are traded in each month.

4, CPI: The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price relatively infrequently. [1]

5, Core CPI: The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes in the price index measure the inflation rate between any two time periods. [2]

6, gdp: Gross domestic product, the featured measure of U.S. output, is the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.[3]

7, unemployment rate: The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. [4]

8, m1: M1 consists of (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and (3) other checkable deposits (OCDs), consisting of negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, and automatic transfer service, or ATS, accounts at depository institutions, share draft accounts at credit unions, and demand deposits at thrift institutions.[5]

9, m2: M2 consists of M1 plus (1) savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts); (2) small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000) less individual retirement account (IRA) and Keogh balances at depository institutions; and (3) balances in retail money market funds (MMFs) less IRA and Keogh balances at MMFs. [6]

10, DFF: The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. [7]
