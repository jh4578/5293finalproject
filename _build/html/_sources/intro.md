# Proposal

## Introduction:

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach for predicting Google's stock price. The prediction model will utilize historical data and employ three different training and prediction models. Three models will be used: Linear & GLM, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, and Long Short Term Memory Network. Data will be sourced from Yahoo:  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?period1=1092873600&period2=1679356800&interval=1wk&filter=history&frequency=1wk&includeAdjustedClose=true 


## Objectives:
Our primary goal is to develop a model that is accurate and reliable for predicting Google's stock price. To achieve this objective, the following sub-objectives will be pursued:

1. To collect and preprocess the historical data from Yahoo Finance.

2. To implement and train the three models mentioned above on the preprocessed data.

3. To evaluate the performance of each model using various performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-Squared.

4. To select the most suitable model based on the evaluation metrics and deploy it for the final prediction of the stock of Google.


## Methodology:

The project will follow the following methodology:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

2. Model Implementation and Training

3. Model Evaluation

4. Model Deployment and Final Prediction

## Expected Outcomes:
The following outcomes are expected from the project:

1. A machine learning-based approach to predict the stock of Google.

2. A comparison of the performance of the Linear & GLM model, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, and Long Short Term Memory Network.

3. The identification of the best-performing model for the prediction of the stock of Google.

4. An accurate prediction of the stock of Google for the next week.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the proposed project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to predict the stock of Google using three different models: Linear & GLM model, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, and Long Short Term Memory Network. The project will follow a methodology that involves data collection and preprocessing, model implementation and training, model evaluation, and model deployment and final prediction. The expected outcomes include an accurate prediction of the stock of Google for the next week and the identification of the best-performing model for the prediction of the stock of Google.
